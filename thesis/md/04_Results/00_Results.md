# Experimental Results

- [TODO: Add chapter introduction]
  - in this chapter wwe will test our propoesed algorithms and solution approaches on a set of instance graphs and graph types proposed by [Hartmanna dn pidnebesna]. We will perform a parameter searecha and evaluate the performance of the methods with respect to time, and solution quality. 

## Data Instances Descriptions

- Admit data instances are adapted from the instances used by Pidnebesna, Hartmann

### ER

- [TODO: Include a description of ]
- cool property of the graph that is is most likely asyymetrric (p=0.5) [TODO: look for original paper stating this]

### BA

- this is anaother widely used graph instance type class that is based on the preferrential attachment idea, the graph is scale free and might be interesting

### LRM ER Rewired

### Brain Data
