"""
Implements the Manifold Optimization method for the Approximate Symmetry Problem.

This module provides a solver for the Relaxed Approximate Symmetry Problem (rASP)
by framing it as an unconstrained optimization problem on a Riemannian manifold.
Instead of treating the constraints of the Birkhoff polytope algebraically, this
approach embraces the geometry of the set of doubly stochastic matrices.

The interior of the Birkhoff polytope is treated as the Doubly Stochastic
Manifold, equipped with the Fisher Information Metric. This allows the use of
standard gradient-based optimization algorithms, such as Steepest Descent or
Trust Regions, adapted to operate on this curved space. Key operations like
gradient computation and movement (retraction) are defined by the manifold's
geometry.

This implementation uses the `pymanopt` library, which automates many of the
complex manifold operations and integrates with PyTorch for automatic
differentiation of the objective function.
